## Overview

In our [LLM evaluation reproducibility report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09501), we found that chaning Batch size and GPU counts can impact the reasoning trace a lot This is due to the differences in float-point arthmetic order across configurations. Thinking Machines Lab introduced [batch-invariant operators](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/), which ensure deterministic outputs across different batch sizes. However, nondeterminism remains unresolved when changing TP sizes, a common scenario in RL that training and rollout engines employ different parallelization strategy.

We propose TBIK, a TP-invariant matmul method that achieves determinism by strictly controlling the reduction order in matrix multiplications. By replacing TP-size-sensitive(Row-Split) layers such as o_proj and down_proj with our TP-invariant counterparts, and by employing a tree-structured cross-GPU all-reduce, we achieve fully deterministic LLM inference across different TP sizes.

Furthermore, we align training engine FSDP (TP=1) with the vLLM rollout engine under tensor parallelism (TP>1), enabling bitwise-identical true on-policy reinforcement learning.

## Setup

### 1. Install uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Clone and setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility
cd llm_reproducibility
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install core dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

cd torchtitan
uv pip install -e .
cd ..
uv pip install -e ".[rl]"
```

### 6. Verify installation
```bash
python verify_installation.py
python simple_matmul.py
```

## How to use TBIK?
Unlock deterministic vLLM inference and true policy reinforcement learning with just a single, lightweight `apply_patches()` function! It automatically applies the appropriate patches based on the environment variables.

### Deterministic Matmul
Matmul operations have different reduction order when splitting over different numbers of GPUs. With our tree-based matmul, the result of matrix multiplication remains invariant regardless of the number of splits. You can switch between the standard matmul and the tree-based matmul by setting `TP_INVARIANT_MATMUL=0/1`.
```bash
TP_INVARIANT_MATMUL=1 python simple_matmul.py
```

### Deterministic LLM inference
In vLLM’s model implementation, the `o_proj` layer in the attention module and the `down_proj` layer in the FFN use 'row-split' linear layers. By replacing these row-split linear layers with our TP-invariant counterparts and co-designing both the intra-kernel reduction order and the inter-GPU reduction order(and also batch invariant operations), vLLM can achieve deterministic inference across different runtime settings.
```bash
VLLM_BATCH_INVARIANT=1 VLLM_TP_INVARIANT=1 python simple_inference.py
```

### Bitwise consistent on-policy RL
Following [spirl](https://github.com/teja-rao/spirl), we use vLLM for inference and TorchTitan for training in our demo code to make the workflow easier to try for users. In practical RL training pipelines, the training engine typically runs with FSDP (TP = 1), while the inference engine runs with TP > 1. This mismatch in numerical precision across the two engines is the fundamental cause of training instability in RL. By introducing TBIK and aligning the operators used in both the training and inference engines, we address this issue at its root, making true on-policy RL feasible.
```bash
[CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES] VLLM_BATCH_INVARIANT=1 VLLM_TP_INVARIANT=1 ALIGN_TRAIN_INFERENCE=1 python simple_rl.py
```

**We now also support running the training engine on multiple GPUs, enabling larger-scale RL training.** To launch the FSDP-based multi-GPU RL training setup with TBIK, run:

```bash
bash fsdp_rl_tbik.sh
```

To compare against other settings, such as the baseline or BIO, run:
```bash
bash fsdp_rl_baseline.sh
bash fsdp_rl_bio.sh
```
